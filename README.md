# Kubernetes Networking Observations with Kindnet

This repository accompanies the **Medium article series** on Kubernetes pod-to-pod networking internals using [Kindnet CNI](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/images/kindnetd) in a Minikube cluster. Each article explores how Kubernetes routes traffic within and across nodes in a Kindnet setupâ€”**without bridges, overlays, or tunnels**.

## Repository Structure

This repo provides manifests used to validate L3 routing behavior in Kindnet with both single-node and multi-node Minikube setups.

* `manifests/tshark.yaml`: Deploys debug pods for inspecting **intra-node** communication using `tshark` and `iproute2` inside a single-node Minikube cluster.
* `manifests/tshark-multi-node.yaml`: Targets a **two-node Minikube** cluster to capture and trace **inter-node** traffic between pods scheduled on different nodes.

## Get Started

```bash
# Single-node setup
kubectl apply -f manifests/tshark.yaml

# Multi-node (two-node Minikube) setup
kubectl apply -f manifests/tshark-multi-node.yaml
```
